Sustainable development</h2><em>        <h3>* Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. <br>
* It contains two key concepts within it:


<br>

* The concept of 'needs', in particular, the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
                <br>
                

* The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.</h3></em>
